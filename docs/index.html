<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
	<p>Cal Rally Com is interested in creating an interactive experience for people who attend football games to play with while theyâ€™re bored during the game, timeouts, or halftime. We think that being able to orient meshes based on an attendee's position in the football stands would be useful and all them to watch recaps. If we can orient a mesh correctly from every point in the stadium, then we can properly do things like orient the paths that players have moved during the game, the plays that each team was running, etc. 
	</p><p> The goal of this project is to make live events more entertaining. Some hard parts of this project are figuring out where the user is in the stadium, extracting features from the stadium (corners, end goal lines, etc), and displaying the features in the correct place when you point your phone at the field.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Results</h3>	
    <p> We hope to be able to do this segmentation on every frame or maybe for every other frame. We hope to be able to see how much that would impact our accuracy as well.</p>
